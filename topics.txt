=========================================Taints and Tolerations Start=============================================
Taint - can be applied on Node to restrict the pod placement by the scheduler.
Tolerations - can be used in pod definition file to allow or place the pod on the tained node if the scheduler chose the tainted node is a good fit for the allocation or placement.
#kubectl describe nodes node-name | grep Taint
#kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect
taint-effect can be - NoSchedule | PreferNoSchedule | NoExecute

NoSchedule - It will allow only the pods that has tainted tolerations, No effect on existing pods.
PreferNoSchedule - It will allow only the pods has tained tolerations, But cannot guarentee, No Effect on existing pods.
NoExecute - It will allow only the pods that has tainted tolerations, Also evicts the existing pods.
#kubectl taint nodes node01 app=green:NoSchedule
